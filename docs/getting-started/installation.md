Cherry is pretty simple to install. Like any npm package.

## Requirements

First of all, you'll need to match the requirement of the framework.

Because it is a backend Javascript framework, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
> Cherry is tested to work for node >= 10.
> The version under Node 10 may work or not but they are not supported.

To check you Node.js version, you run this command in a terminal :

```

$ node -v
v12.4.0

```


## Download Cherry

To download Cherry and get it in your project, go in you project folder and run this command :

```bash

$ npm i @lund-org/cherry
or
$ yarn add @lund-org/cherry

```

Or if you need to install it for production :

```bash

$ npm i @lund-org/cherry --production
or
$ yarn add @lund-org/cherry && yarn install --production

```

And that's it, you now have Cherry in your dependencies. Let's see how to use it in the next chapter !
