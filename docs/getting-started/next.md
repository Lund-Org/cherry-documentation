I'm pretty sure you think you're like a super-hero with you Cherry application. But your Cherry is still a tiny seed and needs to grow like your knowledge of the framework. With the following documentation chapters, you will be able to understand all the features provided by Cherry and maybe you'll become a Cherry Expert. **Maybe**.

If you still have questions **after reading the documentation** or if you found a bug, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/issues) on Github or even contribute by submiting [pull requests](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/pulls).
