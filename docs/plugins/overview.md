Now, we will talk about the plugins you can add to Cherry to add features. As seen before, Cherry has been made to provide the minimum necessary to build a website to be light as possible and then you add what you need, with the goal to not have additionnal code useless for your project.

There are 2 types of plugins.
- The plugins registered in the core of the framework. These plugins are basic features. They have an identifier recognized inside of the framework. We already spoke about one of them : The view rendering plugin. We will talk about it in the next chapters.
- The plugins registered for your own usage through the Cherry instance. If you want to create a plugin which is not a "core plugin", Cherry won't interact with it

Let's take a look at a plugin you already used previously to render your HTML views with templates : The view rendering plugin.
